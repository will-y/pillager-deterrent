# Pillager Deterrent

Pillager patrols can be annoying. This mod adds two methods to stop the patrols from spawning.

The first is a ring that you can keep in your inventory (or curios slot).

The second is a banner that you can place down that will prevent patrol spawns in a configurable area around it.

## Obtaining
You can craft both the banner and the ring:

The ring also has a 50% chance to spawn in a pillager outpost chest.

## Config Options
You can configure the range of the banner with the config option `banner_range`.
